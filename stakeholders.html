                              Koperniakan is an teaches astronomy at Harvard University who has taught for over 15 years. Established in 1962,
                              Harvard University has become an world renowned university that teaches 21,000 students yearly. Koperniakan is head of
                              the department of astronomy locate at 60 Garden Street and 160 Concord Avenue (M Building), where he makes faculty

                            </p>

                            <p>
                              Koperniakan takes pride in extended learning after hours. He believes these extended hours give students more engagement,
                              and hopes that it can build interest in astronomy. Extra laboratory workshops at night are the main source of engagement
                              that students have, but these classes are highly restricted based on weather conditions and use of the observatory.
                              Koperniak goal is to find a way to bypass this constraint and to allow his classes to be more engaging for students.

                            Koperniakan has minimal experience with virtual reality applications. After a colleague from work introduced him to virtual reality
                            google maps, he saw the educational potential of VR. Using funding from the University, Koperniakan purchased one HTC VIVE
                            and this product. He was astounded by how easy it was to use on the first try.
