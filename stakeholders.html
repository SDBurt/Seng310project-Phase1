                            <p>
                              The first user case is Galileo Koperniak, a passionate teacher residing in
                              Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the United States of America. Koperniak has
                              been teaching astronomy at Harvard University for over 15 years.
                              Established in 1962, Harvard University has become an world renowned
                              university that teaches 21,000 students yearly. Koperniak is the head of
                              the Department of Astronomy located at 60 Garden Street and 160 Concord
                              Avenue (M Building). That is where he makes faculty decisions affecting the
                              learning outcomes for the astronomy classes.
                              <br />
                              Koperniak takes pride in providing extended
                              learning after hours for the students of astronomy. He believes the
                              extended hours allow for extra engagement and help increase interest in
                              astronomy. Extra laboratory workshops at night are the main source of
                              engagement for students. However, these classes are highly restricted
                              based on weather conditions and the permission to use the observatory.
                              Koperniak’s goal is to find a way to bypass this constraint and to allow
                              his classes to be more immersive regardless of outside conditions or access
                              to the observatory. The VR Galaxy Map application would help Koperniak
                              accomplish this goal.

                              year medical student living in Oxford, England. Gates goes to school at
                              Oxford University, which was rated the top university 2016-2017 and accepts
                              only 1 in 5 students per year. Gates has a very high standing in all his
                              classes, and participates in many clubs and other extracurriculars.
                              <br />
                              During summers, Gates loves to travel and has been on

                              <br />
                              Alongside traveling, Gates loves video games, especially those that
                              support virtual reality. During his spare time, he can be found plugged
                              into his VR set playing the latest games and testing the limits of new VR
                              applications. Some of his favorite games are Paranormal Activity VR, The
                              Deep, Time Machine, Minecraft Hololens, and Google Maps VR.
                              <br />
                              This application would satisfy Gate’s interests in travel and
                              exploration, as well expand his massive collection of VR
